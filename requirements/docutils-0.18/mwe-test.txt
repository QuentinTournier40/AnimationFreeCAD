Synopsis
========
| mwe [**-aq**] [**-b** *file*] [**\--long-long** *which*] *file \...*

Description
===========
To find the common attributes of a variety of objects, it is necessary
to begin, by surveying the *objects* themselves in the concrete. Let us
therefore advert successively to the various modes of action, and
arrangements of human affairs, which are classed, by universal or widely
spread opinion, as Just or as Unjust. The things well known to excite
the sentiments associated with those names, are of a very multifarious
character. I shall pass them rapidly in review, without studying any
particular arrangement.
The previous line will have been spaced with two spaces.

Options
=======
Its arguments are as follows:

-a                         Do all.
-q                         Be quiet.
-b file                    Do everything to *file*.
--long-meme which          Chooses the long named *which*.

Environment
===========
mwe is not affected by environment variables.

Exit status
===========
mwe exits 0 on success.
