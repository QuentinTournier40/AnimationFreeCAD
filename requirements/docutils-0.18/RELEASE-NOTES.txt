Future changes
==============

Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6.

* `html5` writer:

  - Stop setting the "footnote-reference" class value for footnote
    references. Since 0.18, you can use the CSS selector
    ``[role="doc-noteref"]`` instead of ``.footnote-reference``
    (see minimal.css for examples).

  - Remove option "embed_images" (obsoleted by "image_loading_").

    .. _image_loading: docs/user/config.html#image-loading

  - Move attribution behind the blockquote to comply with the `"living
    standard"`__. (HTML5__ allows <cite> elements inside a blockquote.)

    __ https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-blockquote-element
    __ https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/grouping-content.html
       #the-blockquote-element

* `latex2e` writer:

  - Change default of use_latex_citations_ setting to True.

  - Change default of legacy_column_widths_ setting to False.

  - Remove ``use_verbatim_when_possible`` setting
    (use literal_block_env_: verbatim).

* Remove the "rawsource" attribute and argument from nodes.Text:
  we store the null-escaped text in Text nodes since 0.16 so there is no
  additional information in the rawsource.

* Move math format conversion from docutils/utils/math (called from
  docutils/writers/_html_base.py) to a transform__.

  __ docs/ref/transforms.html

* The default HTML writer "html" with frontend ``rst2html.py`` may change
  from "html4css1" to "html5".

  Use ``get_writer_by_name('html')`` or the rst2html.py_ front end, if you
  want the output to be up-to-date automatically.

  Use the "html4" writer or ``rst2html4.py``, if you depend on
  stability of the generated HTML code, e.g. because you use a custom
  style sheet or post-processing that may break otherwise.

* Remove the "html_writer" option of the ``buildhtml.py`` application
  (obsoleted by "writer__").

.. _rst2html.py: docs/user/tools.html#rst2html-py
.. _reference name: docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#reference-names
__ docs/user/config.html#writer
.. _literal_block_env: docs/user/config.html#literal-block-env
.. _use_latex_citations: docs/user/config.html#use-latex-citations


Release 0.18 (2021-10-26)
=========================

.. Note::

   Docutils 0.18.x is the last version supporting Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6.


* Output changes:

  Identifiers:
    During `identifier normalization`_, leading number and hyphen
    characters are no longer stripped from a `reference name`_, if the
    id_prefix_ setting is non-empty.

    Example:
      with ``--id-prefix="DU-"``, a section with title "34. May"
      currently gets the identifier key ``DU-may`` and after the
      change the identifier key ``DU-34-may``.

    The default value for the auto_id_prefix_ setting changed to ``%``:
    "use the tag name as prefix for auto-generated IDs".
    Set auto_id_prefix_ to ``id`` for unchanged auto-IDs.

  HTML5:
    Use the semantic tag <aside> for footnote text and citations, topics
    (except abstract and toc), admonitions, and system messages.
    Use <nav> for the Table of Contents.

    Make "auto" table column widths the default: Only specify column
    widths, if the `"widths" option`_ is set and not "auto".
    The table-style__ setting "colwidths-grid" restores the current default.

    .. _"widths" option: __ docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table
    __ docs/user/config.html#table-style

    Items of a definition list with class argument "details" are
    converted to `details disclosure elements`_. Example::

      ..class:: details

      Summary
        This additional information should be hidden.

    Do not add "compound-first", "compound-middle", or "compound-last" to
    elements nested in a compound. Use child selector and ":first-child",
    ":last-child" pseudo classes instead.
    Use class value "backrefs" instead of "fn-backref" for a span of
    back-references.

    Write footnote brackets and field term colons to HTML, so that they
    are present also without CSS and when copying text.

    Move space character between section number and heading into
    "sectnum" span.

  math-output: html
    Support more commands, fix mapping of commands to Unicode characters.
    Scale variable sized operators and big delimiters with CSS.
    Don't use <tt> element (deprecated in HTML5).
    Use STIX fonts if available.

  LaTeX:
     `legacy_class_functions`_ setting default changed to "False",
     admonitions are now environments.

* New standard Docutils doctree node: <meta__>.

* New configuration settings:
  [latex writers] legacy_column_widths_ and
  [html5 writer] image_loading_.

* Removed files:
  ``iepngfix.htc`` and ``blank.gif`` (IE 6 workaround for `s5_html`).

* Removed function: ``utils.unique_combinations``
  (obsoleted by ``itertools.combinations``).

* Removed attribute: ``HTMLTranslator.topic_classes``
  (check node.parent.classes instead).

* Major refactoring and fixes/additions in
  ``docutils/utils/math/math2html.py`` and
  ``docutils/utils/math/latex2mathml.py``
  (mathematical notation in HTML, cf. `LaTeX syntax for mathematics`_).

* ``nodes.Node.traverse()`` returns an iterator instead of a list.

* Various bugfixes and improvements (see HISTORY_).

  Fix spelling errors in documentation and docstrings. 
  Thanks to Dimitri Papadopoulos.

Release 0.17 (2021-04-03)
=========================

* Numerous bug fixes and improvements
  (for details see the Docutils `HISTORY`_).

* HTML5 writer:

  - New option embed_images_.

  - Use semantic tags (for details see the Docutils `HISTORY`_).

  - Change the `initial_header_level`_ setting's default to "2", as browsers

    sizes.

  - Move non-essential styling from ``minimal.css`` to ``plain.css``
    rsp. ``responsive.css``.

    now ignored. Use ``\DUrole``.

    __ docs/user/latex.html#classes

  - Most helper commands and element definitions are now defined in the
    LaTeX package `docutils.sty`_ and only inserted in the document
    preamble if the stylesheet__ setting does not lists "docutils".

   without the use of the ``2to3`` tool.

* reStructuredText:

  - Keep `backslash escapes`__ in the document tree. This allows, e.g.,
    escaping of author-separators in `bibliographic fields`__.

  __ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#escaping-mechanism
  __ docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#bibliographic-fields

    "html4" or "html5".

  __ html: docs/user/html.html#html

Release 0.14 (2017-08-03)
=========================

* docutils/docs/ref/docutils.dtd:

  - Enable validation of Docutils XML documents against the DTD:

    See math-output_ for details.

* docutils/writers/html4css1:

  - Respect automatic table column sizing.

* docutils/writers/latex2e/__init__.py

  - Handle class arguments for block-level elements by wrapping them
    in a "DUclass" environment. This replaces the special handling for
    "epigraph" and "topic" elements.

* docutils/writers/html4css1/__init__.py
  - Fix [ 3600051 ] for tables in a list, table cells are not compacted.
  - New setting `stylesheet_dirs` (see above).

    Now, it is easy to add a custom stylesheet to Docutils' default
    stylesheet with, e.g., ``--stylesheet_path='html4css1.css, mystyle.css'``

    Changed behaviour of the default settings:
      if there is a file ``html4css1.css`` in the working directory of the
      process at launch, it is used instead of the one provided by Docutils
      in the writer source directory.

  - New default for math-output_: ``HTML math.css``.
  - Avoid repeated class declarations in html4css1 writer
    (modified version of patch [ 104 ]).

  .. _math-output: docs/user/config.html#math-output

* docutils/writers/latex2e/__init__.py

  - Drop the simple algorithm replacing straight double quotes with
    English typographic ones.
    Activate the SmartQuotes_ transform if you want this feature.
  - New setting `stylesheet_dirs`: Comma-separated list of directories
    where stylesheets are found. Used by `stylesheet_path` when expanding

* General:

  - SmartQuotes transform for typographic quotes and dashes.

  - ``docutils/math``, ``docutils/error_reporting.py``, and
    ``docutils/urischemes.py`` moved to the utils package.
    Code importing these modules needs to adapt, e.g.::

      try:
          import docutils.math as math
      except ImportError:
          import docutils.utils.math as math

  - enhanced math and error handling.

    stored in ``docutils/test3/``, tools no longer need conversion.

    If you installed one of Docutils versions 0.7 ... 0.9 with
    ``setup.py install`` under Python 3, remove the spurious
    ``test/`` and ``tools/`` directories in the site library root.


Release 0.9 (2012-05-02)
=========================

========================

* COPYING:

  - Some additions to the Docutils core are released under the 2-Clause BSD
    license.

* General:

  - Handle language codes according to `BCP 47`_.
  - If the specified language is not supported by Docutils,

  - Math support: reStructuredText "math" role and directive,
    ``math`` and ``math_block`` doctree elements.
  - Orphaned "python" reader and "newlatex2e" writer moved to the sandbox.

  .. _BCP 47: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt

* reStructuredText:

  - most directives now support a "name" option that attaches a
    reference name. So you can write ::

      .. figure:: image.png
         :name: figure name

    as a short form of ::

      .. _figure name:

      .. figure:: image.png

Internationalization:

* Added lithuanian mappings.

Components:

* HTML writer:

  - New setting "math-output" with support for HTML, MathML, and LaTeX.

  - Convert image URI to a local file path.
  - Apply [ 3148141 ] fix multicolumn support when a colspanning cell
    has more than one paragraph (Wolfgang Scherer).

* XeTeX writer:

  - New writer generating LaTeX code for compiling with ``xelatex``.

    XeTeX uses unicode and modern font technologies.

    The Docutils wide default (usually "UTF-8") is used instead.

__ docs/user/config.html#docutils-footnotes
__ docs/user/latex.html#hyperlinks
__ docs/user/latex.html#output-encoding

* manpage writer:

  - Titles level 1, that is ``.SH``, always uppercase.
  - Apply patch from mg: literal text should be bold in man-pages.

General:

* io.FileInput opens files as text files with universal newline support
  (mode "rU", configurable with the new optional argument "mode").

* setup.py:

  - Python 3 support: copy test/ and tools/ to the build-dir
    and convert Python sources with 2to3.


Release 0.6 (2009-10-11)
========================

.. Note::

   Docutils 0.5 is the last version supporting Python 2.2.

   Docutils 0.6 is compatible with Python versions from 2.3 up to 2.6
   and convertible to 3.1 code.

.. note::

   The "newlatex" writer is orphaned.

   The recommended way to generate PDF output is to use either the
   LaTeX2e writer or one of the alternatives listed at
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/links.html#pdf.

* reStructuredText:

  - Allow length units for all length specifications.
  - Allow percent sign in "scale" argument of "figure" and "image" directives.
  - Bugfix: The "figalign" argument of a figure now works as intended
    (aligning the figure not its contents).
  - Align images with class "align-[right|center|left]"
    (allows setting the alignment of an image in a figure).
  - Hard tabs in literal inclusions are replaced by spaces. This is
    configurable via the new "tab-width" option of the "include" directive
    (a negative tab-width prevents tab expansion).

* HTML writer:

  - ``--stylesheet`` and ``--stylesheet-path`` options now support a comma
    separated list of stylesheets.

* LaTeX2e writer:

  - New defaults:
    - font-encoding: "T1" (formerly implicitly set by 'ae').
    - use-latex-toc: true (ToC with page numbers).
    - use-latex-footnotes: true (no mixup with figures).
    - Float placement defaults to "here definitely" (configurable).
    - Align of image in a figure defaults to 'center'.
    - Use class defaults for page margins ('typearea' now optional).
  - Support LaTeX packages as ``--stylesheet`` arguments.
  - Use ``bp`` for lengths without unit or unit ``pt``,
    do not convert ``px`` to ``pt``.
  - Do not use 'ae' and 'aeguill' packages if font-encoding is set to ''.
  - Set sub- and superscript role argument as text not math.
  - Support custom roles based on standard roles.
  - Load packages and define macros only if required in the document.
  - All Docutils specific LaTeX macros are prefixed with ``DU``.
  - Better conformance to Docutils specifications with "use_latex_toc".
  - If 'sectnum_xform' is False, the 'sectnum' directive triggers
    section numbering by LaTeX.
  - Use default font in admonitions and sidebar.
  - Typeset generic topic as "quote with title".
  - Use template (file and configuration option).
  - Render doctest blocks as literal blocks (indented).

* ODT writer:

  - moved from sandbox to Doctutils core.

* manpage writer:

  - moved from sandbox to Doctutils core.


Release 0.5 (2008-06-25)
========================

Components:

* HTML writer.

  - Dropped all ``name`` attributes of ``a`` elements (``id`` is
    universally supported now).

* LaTeX2e writer:

========================

.. Note::

   Docutils 0.4.x is the last version that will support Python 2.1.
   Docutils 0.5 will *not* be compatible with Python 2.1; Python 2.2
   or later will be required.

   Docutils 0.4.x is the last version that will make compromises in
   its HTML output for Netscape Navigator 4.  Docutils 0.5 will
   require more up-to-date browsers (the exact definition is to be
   determined).

Components:

* Added an `S5/HTML writer`__ and the rst2s5.py__ front end:
  multi-platform, multi-browser HTML slide shows.

  __ docs/user/slide-shows.html
  __ docs/user/tools.html#rst2s5-py

* The newlatex2e writer is nearing completion.

* Added a DocTree reader, ``publish_doctree`` and
  ``publish_from_doctree`` convenience functions, for document tree
  extraction and reprocessing.
